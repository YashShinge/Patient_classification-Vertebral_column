## Classification of patients based on vertebral column data.

This repo contains a project to classify patients into two categories based on six biomechanical features.   

The two categories are:
1. Normal
2. Abnormal i.e patients with Disk Hernia or Spondylolisthesis

Six biomechanical features are derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine for each patient. 
They are: 
1. pelvic incidence
2. pelvic tilt
3. lumbar lordosis angle
4. sacral slope
5. pelvic radius
6. grade of spondylolisthesis

The data used is from UCI Machine learning repository, and can be found here [here.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Vertebral+Column)
